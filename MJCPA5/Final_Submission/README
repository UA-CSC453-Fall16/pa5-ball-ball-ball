Credit is due where credit is due:

* Dot.hs was adapted from PA3 Group 3881
* Lexer.hs was based off of the class code
* SymbolTable.hs was based off of the class code
* SymbolTable.hs's symTabToString and genSTEs functions
  were adapted from PA4 Group 9748

Notes on compiler:
* Our code is inherently obfucscated!
* Highly upgraded from PA4, it now handles recursion!
